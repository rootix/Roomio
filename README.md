# Roomio

Roomio is a environmental data dashboard which displays data collected by [Ruuvi Tags](https://ruuvi.com/personal/) and stored in an [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/).

I build it for my own purpose and it supports only this Database and the data structure generated by [RuuviCollector](https://github.com/Scrin/RuuviCollector).

## Local development

The InfluxDB Host has to be set trought the environment variable `REACT_APP_INFLUX_DB_HOST` (OS or local .env file)

## Build Docker image

Within the root folder run: `docker build -f Dockerfile --build-arg DB_HOST=<protocol://host:port> -t roomio:latest .`
